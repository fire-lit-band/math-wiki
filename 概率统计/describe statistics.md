## census and sampling
When all the items or individuals in a population are  
studied, we are taking a census.  
If only a portion of the items or individuals in the  
population are studied, we are doing sampling.  
### census
For census, we need only descriptive statistics to  
describe and present census data.  
### sampling
But for sampling, we need both descriptive statistics  
to describe and present sample data and inferential  
statistics to infer about the population based on  
sample results. The inference is not exact and will  
involve uncertainty.
## Data
Data are the set of values associated with one or more variables  
Example: Age of 30 students in a class are 20, 19, 18, 19,... .  
Variables/Data can be categorical (qualitative) or numeric (quantitative)  
Categorical/Qualitative: data are non‐numeric and categorical  
Numeric/Quantitative: data are measured on a numerical scale or counted  

## types of variable
Defined categories
Counted items；
Measured characteristics


Coding categorical data with numbers:
Although the above data values are numbers, the variable is still categorical
Reason for coding: Easier to input into a computer
## visualising
## Categorical Variables
It is accustomed to list the values of the variable in alphabetical order of the  category, or in descending (or ascending) order of the number of customers  
(called frequency) or percent of customers (called relative frequency)
### summary table
大概就是按照字母顺序
然后要么（频率），要么（相对频率）

### bar chart
It is up to you to decide the gap between two bars, as long as the gaps are the same
It is up to you to decide the width of each bar, as long as they all have the same width
Keeping the widths of the bars equal ensuring the area of each bar proportional to the number of individuals in that category
The height of each bar is proportional to the number of individuals in that category
In statistical context, percent is called relative frequency

### pie chart
Slices with very small percentage may need to be combined with others
descending order

## numberical variables
### frequency distribution
Similar to categorical data, numerical data can be presented in the form of table. It is called frequency distribution!
The frequency distribution is a summary table in which the data are arranged into numerically ordered classes

### feature
Exact value of each observation is lost 
 大致分5类即可
The lower value of the first class interval is often the smallest value in the data, or a smaller value which is selected for the reason of convenience, such as 0
Class boundaries include the left endpoint, but not the right
Other endpoint policy can be adopted, but need to be consistent
The number of classes depends on the number of values in the data
	Large data range and high number of observations allow a larger number of class. In general, 5 to 15 classes will be sufficient
在这里的话间隔之间不一定相等(0-10,10-100...)
## histogram
A histogram is a bar chart for grouped numerical data in which the frequencies of each group of numerical data are represented as individual vertical bars
The chart is made from the constructed frequency distribution
The height of the bars is in proportion to the frequency of intervals
There is no gap between bars
	If an interval has 0 frequency, the height of the bar in the histogram is 0
The width of the bars must be identical because the width of the intervals are identical
间隔必须相等

## principles
The graph should not distort the data
The graph should not contain unnecessary adornments (sometimes referred to as chart junk)不要出现无关信息
   The graph should not distort the data不要歪曲数据  
The scale on the vertical axis should begin at zero  从0起
The graph should contain a title   必须要有一个标题
All axes should be properly labeled  轴必须要有一个标签
 The simplest possible graph should be used for a  
given set of data必须要用数据
