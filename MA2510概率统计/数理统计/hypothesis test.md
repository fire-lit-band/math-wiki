A hypothesis is a claim or statement about the population parameter rather than a sample statistic
NULL HYPOTHESIS ($H_0$): A maintained hypothesis that is held to be
true until sufficient evidence to the contrary is obtained
. ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS ( $H_1$or $H_{\alpha}$): A hypothesis against which the
null hypothesis is tested and which will be held to be true if the null is
held false
# test

Hypothesis Always about a population parameter $(\mu)$, rather than a sample statistic $(\bar{X})$
## The null hypothesis, $H_{0}$
States the status quo
Always assumed to be true at start
Represent the current belief in a situation
Always contains the "=", or "\leq", or " $\geq$ "sign
## The alternative hypothesis, $\mathrm{H}_{1}$
The opposite of the null hypothesis
Challenges the status quo
Is generally the hypothesis that the researcher is trying to prove
Never contains the "=", or "\leq",or " $\geq$ "sign

Type I and Type II errors have inverse relationship for a fixed sample size
- If Type I error probability $(\alpha)$ increases, then Type II error probability $(\beta)$ decreases and vice versa
- We cannot decrease both
A criminal trial
- $H_{0}$ : innocent, $H_{1}$ : guilty
- Type I error : convicting an innocent person
- Type II error : let a guilty person go free
- The cost of convicting an innocent person (Type I error) is high
need to choose very small $\alpha$
Choose smaller Type I Error when the cost of rejecting the null hypothesis is high
p-value说的是用来验证的那个sample的条件的概率
Compare the p-value with the level of significance $\alpha$
If $\mathrm{p}$-value $<\alpha$, reject $\mathrm{H}_{0}$
- Otherwise, do not reject $\mathrm{H}_{0}$
