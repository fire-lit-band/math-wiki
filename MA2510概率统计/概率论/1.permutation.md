The basic principle of counting
permutation 排列
The number of ordered arrangements or permutations of r objects selected from n **distinct** objects is given by$P_r^n=n(n-1)\dots(n-r-1)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
in general there are $\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\dots n_r!}$

Multinomial coefficients
Consider the problem: A set of $n$ distinct items is to be divided into $r$ distinct groups of respective sizes $n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{r}$ where $\sum_{i=1}^{r} n_{i}=n$ How many different divisions are possible?
Solution:
$$\tbinom{n}{n_1}\tbinom{n-n_1}{n_2}\dots \tbinom{n-n_1-n_2\dots n-{r-1}}{n_r}=\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\dots n_r!}$$
Multinomial theorem:

Solution:
Multinomial theorem:
$$
\left(x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+\underline{x}^{n}\right)^{n}=\sum_{\left(n_{1}, \ldots, n_{r}\right): n_{i} \geq 0, n_{1}+\ldots+n_{r}=n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n \\
n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{r}
\end{array}\right) {x_{1}^{n_{1}} x_{2}^{n_{2}} \ldots x_{r}^{n_{r}}}
$$
where the sum is over all nonnegative integer-valued
vectors $\left(n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{r}\right)$ such that $n_{1}+n_{2}+\ldots+n_{r}=n$.
