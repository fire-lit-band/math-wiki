## Measures of central tendency gives information on the  
central value of the data (i.e. what value do the data center  
around? What is the typical value?)  
Mean（收到极端数据的影响）
Median

## Measures of variation gives information on the dispersion of  the data  
Range  
Interquartile range  
Variance  
Standard deviation
# variance
$E[X]=\left(\sum_{x: p(x)>0} x p(x)\right)$
Example: We say that $I$ is an indicator variable for the event $A$ if
$$
I=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \text { if } A \text { occurs } \\
0 & \text { if } A^{c} \text { occurs }
\end{array} \quad p(X=1)=P(A)\right.
$$
Since $p(1)=P(A), p(0)=1-P(A), \quad E[I]=0 \cdot p(0)+1 \cdot p(1)=P(A)$ That is, Expectation of an indicator variable for the event is equal to the probability that the event occurs
Proposition: If $X$ is a discrete random variable that takes on one of the values $x_{i}, i \geq 1$, with respective probabilities $p\left(x_{i}\right)$ then for any real valued function $g$,             
$$
E[g(X)]=\sum_{i} g\left(x_{i}\right) p\left(x_{i}\right)
$$
E(ax+b)=aE(x)+b
- The mean value (or expected value) of a continuous random variable $X$ is $\mu=E[X]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) d x$
- The variance of a continuous random variable $X$ is
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\sigma^{2}=\operatorname{Var}[X] \\
&=E\left[(X-\mu)^{2}\right]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^{2} f(x) d x \\
&=E\left[X^{2}\right]-\mu^{2}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^{2} f(x) d x-\mu^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
- The standard deviation of a continuous random variable $X$ is
$$
\sigma=\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}[X]}
$$
# skewness

skewness=mean-median
if data are skewed ,the median may be a more appropriate measure of central tendency
### interquartile range
Quartiles split the ranked data into 4 segments with an equal number of values per segment（按照个数)
Q1position:(n+1)/4
Q2position：2(n+1)/4
When calculating the ranked position, use the following rules:
 If the result is a whole number, it is the ranked position to use
If the result is a fractional half (e.g. 2.5, 8.5,...), average the two corresponding data values
f the result is not a whole number or a fractional half, round the result to the nearest integer to find the ranked position
Interquartile range is Q3-Q1 and measures the spread in the middle 50% of the data
Interquartile range is also called the midspread because it covers the middle 50% of the data
Not influenced by outliers or extreme values（不会被极端情况或者极端数据影响）
