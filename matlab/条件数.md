    The  so-called condition number, κ(A), is the ratio between the largest singular value to the smallest  
singular value of A. If κ(A) is very large, then the linear system Ax = b is ill-conditioned, and  
accurate solutions are diffcult or even impossible to get. For this Hilbert matrix, the condition  
number is
   Here rcond is the reciprocal condition estimator. It is some approximation to 1/κ(A). It is not  
exactly 1/κ(A), because κ(A) is more expensive to calculate

cond的意思就是条件数，条件数越大越难算

但通常我们先算rond

rcond
cond
通常来说我们算的是rcond，因为cond比较难算，所以说我们算rcond
cond=条件数，越大，越难算
