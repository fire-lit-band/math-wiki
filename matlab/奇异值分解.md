here U and V are unitary matrices (inverse is conjugate transpose) and S
is the diagonal matrix for the singular values. The largest singular value of a matrix is also the
matrix norm which is dened as ||A|| = max||Ax||/||x||
[U,S,V]=svd(A)执行矩阵 `A` 的奇异值分解，因此 `A = U*S*V'`
a=svd(A)返回A的奇异值

norm(A)

[U,S,V]=svd(A)
